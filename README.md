## deepLearning.ai

This is my attempt on Andrew NG's Deep Learning course offered at Coursera. Check [this website](https://deeplearning.ai) for more information about the course.
The purpose of creating this repo is mostly for my own benifit, as I like how Github allows great readability of iPython notebooks. That being said, don't copy the answers or do anything that might be against Coursera's course policies.
